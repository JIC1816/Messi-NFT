This is a simple NFT contract. I added some features to it, in order to make it more secure and
also reusable. 

I tried to use almost all the elements learned in DACADE tutorials (modifiers, interfaces, functions, etc.).
Maybe I could improved my contract with an actual URI, but I still got some problems with JSON files; I hope
to be more familiarized with it in the next months.

I'm open to suggestions and feedback. Thanks!

PS: this are my first steps into developing, as you can notice. And, also, I'm from Argentina, so my English
maybe isn't that good. Sorry about that.
